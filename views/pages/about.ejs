As my family began to grow, I recently found the need and desire to purchase a larger home. I spoke to a variety of different realtors that showed me a variety of homes until I found Mike Gibson. When making such a large decision, I wanted to work with someone that I could trust.
                  Throughout the past several months, Mike has been there every step of the way. He has always answered every call or email no matter what time of day or night it was. His professionalism, mentorship, knowledge, honesty, and hard work ethic are much respected and appreciated. I never felt that he was just trying to sell me a house, but that he was a mentor to answer my questions and help me to make the best decision for my family.
                  I now consider Mike a friend and would highly recommend him to anyone that is searching for a new home. Thanks again to Mike Gibson and the Joe Hayden Real Estate Team for being such a pleasure to work with. &rdquo;</p>

We met with a couple of realtors before Craig, but we knew instantly that he was the one for us. He is honest and hands-on (he even crawled into creepy attics to check insulation for us!), and he really helped to take the pressure off of us.

                    We never felt forced to make an offer and when we finally found the "one" and ended up in a bidding war, Craig walked us through every step of the negotiations, even suggesting that we write a letter to the sellers to explain why we thought they should choose us. It was an unconventional approach but it worked and we thank Craig for that every day! We have several friends looking for homes and thinking about selling, and we always recommend Craig to them!&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="mb-5">&ldquo;Anne Hayden sold my house and Selby Houston helped me to buy a new one. Two of the hardest working people in the business. They treat you like family, and work as hard as they can for you. If you are going to sell of buy a house I recommend you go with them and the Joe Hayden Real Estate Team. If I was ever going to sell or buy again they would be the first people I would call.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="mb-5">&ldquo;Joe Hayden is a very professional real estate agent who listened to our specific wants and needs. Since we are from out of town, his knowledge about East Louisville and Oldham County area was most helpful. I needed handicap accessibility which is hard to find, and Joe did not waste our time looking at property that had no potential to meet my requirements. We highly recommend for all your real estate needs. &rdquo;</p>
